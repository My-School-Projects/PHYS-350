Conceptual Questions
11
(a) In adding scalars, is 1m + 1m necessarily equal to 2m?
  Yes.
(b) In adding two vectors, each of magnitude 1m, does the resultant
necessarily have a magnitude of 2m? Explain your reasoning in each case.
  No. Only if both vectors have the same direction. In all other cases,
  the resultant magnitude will be less than the sum of the two component magnitudes.

12 Is it possible for the magnitude of a vector (a) to be smaller than the magnitude
of any of its components or (b) to be equal to the magnitude of one of its components?
(a)
  No. The magnitude of a vector can never be greater than the sum of its components'
  magnitudes, or less than the magnitude of it's largest component.
(b)
  Yes. If one of its components has a magnitude of 0, a vector's magnitude will be
  equal to the magnitude of its other component.

13
(a) Does it make sense to say that a vector is negative? Why?
  Yes. Vectors always have positive magnitudes, but their angles can be negative.
  A negative angle has the same magnitude as its positive counterpart, but it has the
  opposite direction.
(b) Does it make sense to say that one vector is the negative of another? Why?
Does your answer here contradict what you said in part (a)?
  Yes. A vector is the opposite of another if it shares the same magnitude, but has
  the opposite direction.
